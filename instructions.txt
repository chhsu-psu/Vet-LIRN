Please use following command to run the script:

perl get_amr_count.pl {Vet-LIRN input file} {NAHLN input file} amr_ncbi.txt > {output file}

where {Vet-LIRN input file}, {NAHLN input file} and {output file} are .txt files, not excel files. 

{Vet-LIRN input file} should be similar to the 2020_Vet-LIRN_E.coli.txt file that fourth column is the AMR genotypes core information and the fifth column is the isolation source (UTI or Other)

{NAHLN input file} should be similar to the 2020_NAHLN_E.coli.txt file that eleventh column is the AMR genotypes core information and the fourth column is the isolation source (UTI or Other)
